I've always loved her.

We've been through thick and thin. From the time that I wasn't close enough with the girls yet, from when I was batteling depression, when I got bad grades at school, she'd been here.

But now she's leaving me.

To protect me? from who?

My fans?
Suwat?
Netizens?

Why does what anyone says even matter?



No. I won't let her go.

SHE'S MINE

MINE

MINE AND ONLY MINE

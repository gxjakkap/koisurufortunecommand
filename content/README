Koisuru Fortune Command

Storyline:
P' Lom-nao, Talent Manager of CPE48, didn't show up for work on October 7th. No one can contact her and she's now missing. 

In this directory, we've prepared files and conversations collected from people related to the case. Find any clue to find out what happend to her.

After you've found your answer, submit them to us using `submit.py` script. Simply run `python3 submit.py` and follow the prompt. Good luck!

p.s.

Some of the files are encoded in a way that we can't read it directly. I've provided a tool to decode it call `decoder.py`. But you'll have to figure out how to use it yourself.

Subject: Situation at our company

Dear K.Suwat,

I know that you've probably heard about me and Chloe already. I am truly sorry that I let my own emotion clouded my judgement and let it escalated this far. I know what I did is wrong and inappropriate as a superior manager. Please take this email as my formal resignation from the company. I'm willing to continue to work here until you find my replacement and all the projects are transitioned ka.

There's another thing that you need to know. Last week, I walked in on fdep9og8dsegiukv8oam akroRALAP BWLwr

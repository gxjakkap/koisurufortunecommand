Hello K.Suwat,

I'd like to voice my concern regarding Chloe's relationship with P' Lom-nao. I have seen them out together in public a couple of times and I'm worried that it would cause harm to both Chloe and our group's reputation. It also raise questions about P'Lom-nao conflict of interest. Just wanted to bring this to your attention ka.

Regards,
Thamonwan Pattanaprasitchote (Seraphine)

Subject: Scheduling PTO for Oct 10-12

Hi P'Lom nao,

I’d like to request paid time off from Thursday, October 10 through Saturday, October 12.
There are no major appearances scheduled for those dates, and I’ve already confirmed with the other members that rehearsals can be adjusted.

Please let me know if you need any additional details ka.

Thank you,
Nattharika Wanna (Javarina)

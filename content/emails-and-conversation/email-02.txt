Subject: Relationship and work ethics

Hello eveyone,

It has been brought to my attention that some of you are in a relationship. I don't want to meddle with your personal life but please know that as a public figure, there's consequences for having a romantic relationship. I'm not prohibitng it, atleast for now. Make sure it's appropriate and that there's no conflict of interest.

Regards,
Suwat Cheachiranon
